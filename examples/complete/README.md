# Complete Example

This example demonstrates how to use the spacelift-automation component to manage Spacelift stacks, including the ability for Spacelift to manage its own configuration.

Normally, this directory would contain a simple root module to spin up a basic example. To showcase a more practical use case where Spacelift manages its own infrastructure, weâ€™ve moved the configuration to the expected path: [examples/complete/components/spacelift-automation/](./components/spacelift-automation/).

By doing this, we provide an example of how to set up Spacelift to automate the management of your infrastructure stacks, including itself.

## Use the Example

1. Prerequisites:
   - Replace the following configuration files with your own values:
     - `backend.tf.json`: Configure your Terraform backend settings
     - `example.tfvars`: Set your Spacelift configuration variables
     - `example.yaml`: Define your stack configuration
       > **Important:** These files may contain sensitive information. Ensure you:
       >
       > - Remove any hardcoded credentials or sensitive values
       > - Have appropriate Spacelift and AWS permissions
       > - Follow your organization's security practices
1. Navigate to the spacelift-automation component directory:
   ```sh
   cd ./components/spacelift-automation/
   ```
1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```sh
   tofu init
   ```
1. Select the worspace:
   ```sh
   tofu workspace select example
   ```
1. Review the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   tofu plan -var-file tfvars/example.tfvars
   ```

This will set up the Spacelift stack that manages itself.

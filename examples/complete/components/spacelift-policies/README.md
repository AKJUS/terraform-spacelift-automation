# `spacelift-policies`

This root module is responsible for managing the Spacelift Policies as code.

A Spacelift Policy is a set of rules and conditions defined to manage and control the behavior of infrastructure as code (IaC) workflows within the Spacelift platform. Spacelift policies are written using the Rego language, which is part of the Open Policy Agent (OPA) framework. These policies can enforce security, compliance, and operational best practices, ensuring that infrastructure changes adhere to organizational standards.

See the official [Spacelift Policy documentaion](https://docs.spacelift.io/concepts/policy/).
